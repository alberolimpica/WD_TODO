# WD_TODO

This is one of the projects of Angela Yu's 201 Web Development Bootcamp.

This is a webpage that has been developed to work with node.js, express and Mongo DB. This application has a list of TODOS for today, but the user can create different list by creating them using the Navigation Bar. All the lists and items will be saved in a database.

The page has been deployed in Heroku.
